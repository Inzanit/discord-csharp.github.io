Welcome to *the* C# Discord community. Be it beginner, general or advanced, we cater to every nook and cranny of the .NET ecosystem. Though we primarily focus on, admittedly, our favourite language, C#, we host channels specifically for F# and VB.NET.

This website introduces you to our community, hand picked resources which members have deemed useful and several other aspects. If you've not yet joined our Discord, [join here]({{site.discord_invite}}) and say hello in [#general]({{site.discord_invite}}).
