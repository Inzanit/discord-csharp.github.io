Members from the guild have hand picked resources which they deem are useful for either learning, or furthering, skills in C#. We realise not everyone learns in the same way, therefore we try to include as many videos and books as possible.

We're always looking to extend resources offered here. If you find anything outdated, a pesky 404 or want to share something: contribute through our Github.
